Method & Approach (How ?)
==

This EA framework is built thanks to a benchmark between others frameworks ...   
... and also thanks to a Best-Of-Breed approach !

Let see this in more details ...


Synthesys

Framework selection
-
All selected frameworks are about "How to design something ?"
![alt text](https://github.com/iPlumb3r/pEAr4pEEr/blob/master/images/How_FrameworkSelection.png)

In each framework, we plan to integrate what is relevant for designing "something".   

So, key "ingredients" to integrate in our own EA framework are :    
* Praxème : Apply the "Separation of Concerns" Principle "everywhere
* Triz, Babok : Integrate the "need VS Solution" dichotomy
* Triz : Integrate the "generic VS specific" dichotomy
* MDA, Merise : Use "logical / technical dichotomy (inside "solution" concerns)

For a better understanding of the benchmark, here is a definition of each concern :

About "why to separate Business concerns from others concerns ?" :
-
<table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Concern</th>
            <th>Reason Why</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>Functional</td>
            <td>Elements of this concern incarnates some useful abstraction of business concern elements. E.g. making configuration management is NOT an end in itself. Its just a generic manner to handle differents specifics problems.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Project</td>
            <td>Elements of this concern incarnates a specific manner to treat a given project in a given context. Those elements are not invariants because they can change depending of the context</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Organization</td>
            <td>Elements of this concern incarnates the way of the enterprise is organized at a given moment.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Transition</td>
            <td>Elements of this concern allow to formalizes the way to answer to the buisness in a given situation (e.g. "as is" situation) or in another situation (e.g. "to be" situation) .</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>
